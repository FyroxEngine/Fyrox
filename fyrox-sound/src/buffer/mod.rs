//! This module provides all needed types and methods to create/load sound buffers from different sources.
//!
//! # Overview
//!
//! Buffer is data source for sound sources in the engine. Each sound sound will fetch samples it needs
//! from a buffer, process them and send to output device. Buffer can be shared across multiple sources,
//! this is why each instance wrapped into `Arc<Mutex<>>`. Why not just load a buffer per source? This
//! is just inefficient memory-wise. Sound samples are very heavy: for example a mono sound that lasts
//! just 1 second will take ~172 Kb of memory (with 44100 Hz sampling rate and float sample representation).
