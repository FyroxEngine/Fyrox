//! Sound source module.
//!
//! # Overview
//!
//! Sound source is a "work horse" of the engine. It allows you to play sounds, apply effects (such as positioning, HRTF,
//! etc.), control volume, pitch, panning and other. Exact behaviour defined by a variant of sound buffer (generic or
//! spatial). See docs at those modules for more info.
