# fyrox-sound

Sound library for games and interactive applications written in Rust.

**NOTE:** even though this crate has `fyrox` prefix in its name, it can be used separately without any issues.

## Key features

- Generic and Spatial sound sources.
- Built-in streaming for large sounds.
- Raw samples playback support.
- WAV format support (non-compressed).
- Vorbis/ogg support (using [lewton](https://crates.io/crates/lewton)).
- [HRTF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head-related_transfer_function) support for excellent positioning and binaural effects.
- Reverb effect.

## Examples

Examples can be found in `./examples`. Make sure you run examples with `--release` flag, `debug` version is very slow and may cause tearing of output sound.

## Supported OS

- Windows (DirectSound)
- Linux (alsa)
- macOS (CoreAudio)
- WebAssembly (WebAudio)

## HRTF

This library has full HRTF support, it uses HRIR spheres generated using [IRCAM](http://recherche.ircam.fr/equipes/salles/listen/) HRIR database. HRIR spheres are produced using a small tool written in C++ - [hrir_sphere_builder](https://github.com/mrDIMAS/hrir_sphere_builder ). It is very important to find HRTF that suits you because they're very individual and the overall perception is fully defined by the use of correct HRTF.

Any contributions are very appreciated! Check the `Issues` page to see how can you help the project.

8. [Overlap-save convolution](https://dsp-nbsphinx.readthedocs.io/en/nbsphinx-experiment/nonrecursive_filters/segmented_convolution.html) - works much better when impulse response changes, there are only phase shift issues which are more or less acceptable.
