# Use this switch only for development or debugging purposes.
# Do not switch the switch inside cargo project, it's useful
# switching only in installed programm.
#
# Switching the switch will make programm generate new files
# inside cargo project, instead directories that gives
# OS to installed programms, like Program Files on windows
# or .config in linux. You maybe will need it if it's easier
# for you to look at the new files inside cargo project, thus
# you haven't got to climb into directories provided by OS.
#
# to use it, simply replace boolean false with true(in lowercase).
