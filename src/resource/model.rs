#![warn(missing_docs)]

//! Contains all data structures and method to work with model resources.
//!
//! Model is an isolated scene that is used to create copies of its data - this
//! process is known as `instantiation`. Isolation in this context means that
//! such scene cannot be modified, rendered, etc. It just a data source.
//!
//! All instances will have references to resource they were created from - this
//! will help to get correct vertex and indices buffers when loading a save file,
//! loader will just take all needed data from resource so we don't need to store
//! such data in save file. Also this mechanism works perfectly when you changing
//! resource in external editor (3Ds max, Maya, Blender, etc.) engine will assign
//! correct visual data when loading a saved game.
//!
//! # Supported formats
//!
//! Currently only FBX (common format in game industry for storing complex 3d models)
//! and RGS (native rusty-editor format) formats are supported.
