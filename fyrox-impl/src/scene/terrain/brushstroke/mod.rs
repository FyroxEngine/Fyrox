//! The brushstroke module contains tools for modifying terrain textures.
//! It uses a triple-buffer system to separate the UI mouse movements
//! from the update of the data within the actual textures.
//! 1. The first buffer is a [std::sync::mpsc::channel] that is used to send
//! messages to control a thread that processes brush strokes.
//! These messages are [BrushThreadMessage]. Some of the messages
//! are processed as soon as they are received, but [BrushThreadMessage::Pixel]
//! messages are sent to the next buffer.
//! 2. The pixel message buffer holds a limited number of pixel messages.
//! It serves to merge redundent pixel messages to spare the thread from
//! repeating work. It is expected that brush operations will paint multiple
//! times to the same pixel in quick succession.
//! Once the new value for a pixel has been calculated, the value is stored
//! in the third buffer.
//! 3. The [StrokeData] buffer stores every change that a particular brush stroke
//! has made to the texture. Because modifying a texture is a nontrivial operation,
//! modified pixels are allowed to accumulate to some quantity before the new pixel
//! values are actually written to the textures of the terrain.
//! [StrokeChunks] is used to keep track of which pixels are waiting to be written
//! to which terrain chunks.
