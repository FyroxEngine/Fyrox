/// Animation blending state machine is used to blend multiple animation as well as perform automatic smooth transitions
/// between states.
///
/// # Terminology
///
/// `Node` - is a part of sub-graph that backs _states_ with animations. Typical nodes are `PlayAnimation`, `BlendAnimations`,
/// `BlendAnimationsByIndex`, etc. Nodes can be connected forming a tree, some node could be marked as output - its animation
/// will be used in parent state.
/// `State` - is a final source of animation for blending. There could be any number of states, for example typical
/// states are: `run`, `idle`, `jump` etc. A state could be marked as _entry_ state - it will be active at the first frame
/// when using the machine. There is always one state active.
/// `Transition` - is a connection between states that has transition time, a link to a parameter that defines whether the
/// transition should be performed or not. Transition is directional; there could be any number of transitions between any
/// number of states (loops are allowed).
/// `Parameter` - is a named variable of a fixed type (see `Parameters` section for more info).
/// `Layer` - is a separate state graph, there could be any number of layers - each with its own mask.
/// `Mask` - a set of handles to nodes which will be excluded from animation on a layer.
/// `Pose` - a final result of blending multiple animation into one.
///
/// Summarizing everything of this, we can describe animation blending state machine as a state graph, where each state has its
/// own sub-graph (tree) that provides animation for blending. States can be connected via transitions.
///
/// # Parameters
///
/// Parameter is a named variable of a fixed type. Parameters are used as a data source in various places in the animation
/// blending state machines. There are three main types of parameters:
///
/// `Rule` - boolean value that used as a trigger for transitions. When transition is using some rule, it checks the value
/// of the parameter and if it is `true` transition starts.
/// `Weight` - real number (`f32`) that is used a weight when you blending multiple animations into one.
/// `Index` - natural number (`i32`) that is used as an animation selector.
///
/// Each parameter has a name, it could be pretty much any string.
///
/// # Layers
///
/// Layer is a separate state graph. Layers mainly used to animate different parts of humanoid (but not only) characters. For
/// example there could a layer for upper body and a layer for lower body. Upper body layer could contain animations for aiming,
/// melee attacks while lower body layer could contain animations for standing, running, crouching, etc. This gives you an
/// ability to have running character that could aim or melee attack, or crouching and aiming, and so on with any combination.
/// Both layers use the same set of parameters, so a change in a parameter will affect all layers that use it.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// Let have a quick look at simple state machine graph with a single layer:
///
/// ```text

///
/// Here we have `Walk`, `Idle`, `Run` _states_ which uses different sources of poses:
///
/// - `Run` and `Idle` both directly uses respective animations as a pose source.
/// - `Walk` - is the most complex here - it uses result of blending between `Aim` and `Walk` animations with different
/// weights. This is useful if your character can only walk or can walk *and* aim at the same time. Desired pose
/// determined by `Walk Weight` and `Aim Weight` parameters combination (see `Parameters` section for more info).
/// **Note:** Such blending is almost never used on practice, instead you should use multiple animation layers. This
/// serves only as an example that the machine can blend animations.
///
/// There are four transitions between three states each with its own _rule_. Rule is just Rule parameter which can
/// have boolean value that indicates that transition should be activated. The machine on the image above can be created
/// using code like so:
///
/// ```no_run
/// use fyrox_animation::{
///     machine::{
///         Machine, State, Transition, PoseNode,
///         Parameter, PlayAnimation, PoseWeight, BlendAnimations, BlendPose
///     },
///     core::pool::Handle
/// };
/// use fyrox_core::pool::ErasedHandle;
///
/// // Assume that these are correct handles.
/// let idle_animation = Handle::default();
/// let walk_animation = Handle::default();
/// let aim_animation = Handle::default();
///
/// let mut machine = Machine::<ErasedHandle>::new();
///
/// let root_layer = &mut machine.layers_mut()[0];
///
/// let aim = root_layer.add_node(PoseNode::PlayAnimation(PlayAnimation::new(aim_animation)));
/// let walk = root_layer.add_node(PoseNode::PlayAnimation(PlayAnimation::new(walk_animation)));
///
/// // Blend two animations together
/// let blend_aim_walk = root_layer.add_node(PoseNode::BlendAnimations(
///     BlendAnimations::new(vec![
///         BlendPose::new(PoseWeight::Constant(0.75), aim),
///         BlendPose::new(PoseWeight::Constant(0.25), walk)
///     ])
/// ));
///
/// let walk_state = root_layer.add_state(State::new("Walk", blend_aim_walk));
///
/// let idle = root_layer.add_node(PoseNode::PlayAnimation(PlayAnimation::new(idle_animation)));
/// let idle_state = root_layer.add_state(State::new("Idle", idle));
///
/// root_layer.add_transition(Transition::new("Walk->Idle", walk_state, idle_state, 1.0, "WalkToIdle"));
/// root_layer.add_transition(Transition::new("Idle->Walk", idle_state, walk_state, 1.0, "IdleToWalk"));
///
/// ```
///
/// This creates a machine with a single animation layer, fills it with some states that are backed by animation
/// sources (either simple animation playback or animation blending). You can use multiple layers to animate a single
/// model - for example one layer could be used for upper body of a character and other is lower body. This means that
/// locomotion machine will take control over lower body and combat machine will control upper body.
///
/// Complex state machines quite hard to create from code, you should use ABSM editor instead whenever possible.
