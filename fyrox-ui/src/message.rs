///
/// ```rust

/// #     UserInterface,
/// # };
/// #
/// // Message must be debuggable, comparable, cloneable.
/// #[derive(Debug, PartialEq, Clone)]
/// enum MyWidgetMessage {
///     DoSomething,
///     Foo(u32),
///     Bar { foo: u32, baz: u8 },
/// }
///
/// impl MyWidgetMessage {
///     // The first option is used to create constructors plain enum variants:
///     //
///     //                  enum name       variant            name          perform layout?

///     define_constructor!(MyWidgetMessage:DoSomething => fn do_something(), layout: false);

///     // The second option is used to create constructors for single-arg tuple enum variants:
///     //
///     //                  enum name     variant    name arg    perform layout?
///     //                      v            v         v   v           v

/// Message is basic communication element that is used to deliver information to widget or to user code.
///
/// ## Motivation
///
/// This UI library uses message passing mechanism to communicate with widgets. This is very simple and reliable mechanism that
/// effectively decouples widgets from each other. There is no direct way of modify something during runtime, you have to use
/// messages to change state of ui elements.
///
/// ## Direction
///
/// Each message marked with "Direction" field, which means supported routes for message. For example [`crate::button::ButtonMessage::Click`]
/// has "Direction: To/From UI" which means that it can be sent either from internals of library or from user code. However
/// [`crate::widget::WidgetMessage::Focus`] has "Direction: From UI" which means that only internal library code can send such messages without
/// a risk of breaking anything.
///
/// ## Threading
///
/// UiMessage is nor Send or Sync. User interface is a single-thread thing, as well as its messages.
///
/// ## Examples
///
/// ```rust
/// use fyrox_ui::{
///     core::pool::Handle, define_constructor, message::MessageDirection, message::UiMessage, UiNode,
///     UserInterface,
/// };
///
/// // Message must be debuggable and comparable.

///     Foo(u32),
///     Bar { foo: u32, baz: u8 },

///     define_constructor!(MyWidgetMessage:Foo => fn foo(u32), layout: false);
///     define_constructor!(MyWidgetMessage:Bar => fn bar(foo: u32, baz: u8), layout: false);

///     // Send MyWidgetMessage::DoSomething
///     ui.send_message(MyWidgetMessage::do_something(
///         my_widget,
///         MessageDirection::ToWidget,
///     ));
///     // Send MyWidgetMessage::Foo
///     ui.send_message(MyWidgetMessage::foo(
///         my_widget,
///         MessageDirection::ToWidget,
///         5,
///     ));
///     // Send MyWidgetMessage::Bar
///     ui.send_message(MyWidgetMessage::bar(
///         my_widget,
